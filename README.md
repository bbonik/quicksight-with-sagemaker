# quicksight-with-sagemaker
Building a ML inference pipeline in SageMaker and using it in QuickSight to create predictive dashboards.

This repo is a clone of the [original AWS repo](https://github.com/aws-samples/quicksight-sagemaker-integration-blog.git), accompanying this [AWS blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/making-machine-learning-predictions-in-amazon-quicksight-and-amazon-sagemaker).

It includes many fixes and optimizations, as well as a new notebook with updated snapshots from the new UI of QuickSight.
